# Multi-Client-TCP-Communication
Final Project for ECGR 3123:Communications and Networking

Written by Wallace Obey and Kevin Granados

C++ project for clients to connect to the same server and receive and send messages at the same time.

The server code is working fine for accepting new clients and sending and receiving data.

The clients code needs to be modified in order to get messages that are sent to the server as the come in from other
clients. this will require multi-threading to be implemented to listen and send messages at the same time.
